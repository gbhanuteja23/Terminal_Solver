Finally I have completely made my game, *Terminal Solver*. 


I will share the link once I have done the final changes and have uploaded it on sharemygame.com .



Instructions for the Game:-

1. This is a  Word Guessing Game .  

2. There are 3 levels in this game with increasing difficulty. 

3. The user has to choose the level, in which they want to play and enter their choice in integer  like 1 or 2 or 3.

4. After entering the level, based on the level, it will generate a word which won't be displayed but it's hint 
   will be displayed in the form of jumbled letters.

  eg:-  If *arrest* word is generated, it will show the hint as *hint: raerst*. The user has to unjumble these letters and eneter the correct word
        to proceed to the Game Winnnig Menu.

5.  The user can enter their guesses as many time as they wish, until they are exhausted. (:
    But the user, doesn't have to waste his time, he can go to Main Game Menu at any time and can choose a 
    different level by just entering *Menu* in the Terminal.


6.  If the user guessses the correct word, the Winning Screen will be shown. There, he will be shown a visual gift on Terminal which is 
    made up of ASCII patterns.

7. If the user wants to play the game again after the Winning Screen is displayed, he can go to the main Menu by
   entering *Menu*. 



THANKS,
That's all for the Instructions.

ENJOY THE GAME!!!!
